### Exercises from day 5.4 - Web Storage.

Build a web page which reads a written content (i.e. a page book, newspaper note, any news...). Use reader preferences to improve the experience of who is reading the page. 

#### The reader must be able to:
1. Change the background color;
2. Change the color text;
3. Change the font size;
4. Change the line spacing;
5. Change the font family.

These preferences must be saved in such a way that whenever the user reloads the page, these preferences are applied again.
