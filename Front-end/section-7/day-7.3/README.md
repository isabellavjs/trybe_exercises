### Exercies from section 7.3: JS Unit tests

- Part I: Exercises from 1 to 5

Implement unit tests for each given function. 

- Part II: Exercises from TDD-1 to TDD-8

These exercises aim practicing the TDD (test driven development) approach. They are divided in two groups: from tdd-1 to tdd-4 it was required to create functions for the given unit tests, while exercises from tdd-4 to tdd-8 asked to check if the given function is working. If the function does not work, the exercise required modifications to the function and the corresponding test.
